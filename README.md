# Comparing_means_and_fitting_distributions
In this report I will be assessing a treatment plan to evaluate the impact of a nutritional supplement on the weight of mice and rats, which will come from a randomly generated dataset. To do this I will be generating two datasets: one for mice and the other for rats. These datasets consist of 200 values before and after treatment. To compare the results. The tests I will be using will differ in terms of the types of tests that can be performed, as the mice will come from a normal distribution. Whereas, the dataset about rats will come from the Weibull distribution, which requires a non-parametric test. For this reason, I will be performing different tests for the hypothesis tests.
